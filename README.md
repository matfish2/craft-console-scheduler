# Console Scheduler

This package adds the ability to schedule console commands directly from code.

## Why?

While you may write a cron configuration entry for each task you need to schedule on your server, this can quickly
become a pain, because your task schedule is not recorded to source control and you must SSH into your server to view
your existing cron entries, add additional entries or change the schedule.

This package will allow you to:
1. Define only one command in `crontab` and the rest will be handled in code.
2. Use intuitive and readable fluent syntax to define the frequency.
3. Log all executed commands to a dedicated `console-scheduler-{date}.log` file, along with any output the command may generate and the exit code.

## Installation

1. Include the package:

```
composer require matfish/craft-console-scheduler
```

2. Install the plugin:

```
php craft plugin/install console-scheduler
```

## Initial Setup

Add the following line to your `crontab`

```
* * * * * /var/www/my-site/php craft console-scheduler/schedule >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This will ensure the scheduler runs every minute, and checks for due commands to run.
It is recommended to set the frequency according to the highest frequency your project requires.
E.g if the most frequent command you have runs hourly, there is no need to call the scheduler every minute, and you can use `0 * * * *` instead

## Usage

1. Create a `config/console-scheduler.php` file 
2. Add schedules according to the following example:

```php
return [
    'schedules' => static function (\matfish\ConsoleScheduler\Schedule\SchedulesCollection $schedule) {
        $schedule->command('activity-logs/logs/prune --days=30 --interactive=0')->monthly();
        $schedule->command('cache/clear')->daily()->at('23:00');
    }
];
```

Supported frequencies:

* `everyMinute()`
* `everyTwoMinutes()`
* `everyThreeMinutes()`
* `everyFourMinutes()`
* `everyFiveMinutes()`
* `everyTenMinutes()`
* `everyFifteenMinutes()`
* `everyThirtyMinutes()`
* `hourly()`
* `hourlyAt($time)`
* `everyOddHour()`
* `everyTwoHours()`
* `everyThreeHours()`
* `everyFourHours()`
* `everySixHours()`
* `daily()`
* `dailyAt($time)`
* `twiceDaily($hour1 = 1,$hour2 = 13)`
* `twiceDailyAt($hour1 = 1,$hour2 = 13, $offset = 0)`
* `weekdays()`
* `weedends()`
* `days($day1,$day2, $day3, etc)` - specific days of week
* `sundays()`
* `mondays()`
* `tuesdays()`
* `wednesdays()`
* `thrusdays()`
* `fridays()`
* `satrudays()`
* `weekly()`
* `weeklyOn($dayOfWeek, $time = '0:0')`
* `monthly()`
* `monthlyOn($dayOfMonth, $time)`
* `twiceMonthly($firstDay = 1, $secondDay = 16, $time = '0:0')`
* `lastDayOfMonth($time = '0:0')`
* `quarterly()`
* `quarterlyOn($dayOfQuarter = 1, $time = '0:0')`
* `yearly()`
* `yearlyOn($month = 1, $dayOfMonth = 1, $time = '0:0')`

Methods without a specified time can be followed by an `at` method using fluent syntax. 

If you need more control you can also use the raw `cron` method to define your own frequency, e.g:
```php
$schedule->command('my/cool/command')->cron('*/5 * 3 7 4'); // Every 5 minutes, on day 3 of the month, and on Thursday, only in July
```

## Testing
When `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT=dev` you can pass a `--test` option to the scheduler (in Y-m-d H:i format), to mimic a time which is not the present, and make sure the commands run as expected.
E.g:
```
php craft console-scheduler/schedule --test="2024-01-26 19:05" 
```

The `--test` option will be ignored in any other environment.
